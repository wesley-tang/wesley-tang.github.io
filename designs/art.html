	<section id="My Art">
		<p>I'm not the best at it, but I've made improvements in my art! I haven't had too much formal education on drawing, just a class here and there and what my friends teach me. I draw a lot of dogs, but I also like to draw fancy Square Enix-esque fantasy clothes and armour. To be honest, I only get sketches done haha rip
