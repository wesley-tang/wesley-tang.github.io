		<h1>Project 0</h1>
			<p>The objective of this project was to produce a button that captured a characteristic or persaonlity trait of our client. In this case, we decided to create our button based on our CPSC581 professor, Sydney Pratte!</p>

		<h1>The Interview</h1>
			<p>To develop this button, we needed to first understand our client. Already knowing about her love of her dogs, we decided to dig deeper and found out the following:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>She loves her dogs very much!</li>
				<li>Her bigger dog is Bentley, a black Malamute.</li>
				<li>Her smaller dog is Ferraria, an all white Malamute.</li>
				<li>She likes yoga, specifically the warrier positions.</li>
				<li>She's very afraid of spiders, but her dogs wouldn't care about it.</li>
				<li>She studies feminism and is designing a dress with possibly haptic feedback to show how women are touched compared to men.</li>
				<li>She designed dresses that light up to the proximity of special dog collars. (Bentley's glows red, Ferrari's glows blue.)</li>
				<li>She likes pastel colours, particularily a light blueish green.</li>
				<li>She's very nerdy.</li>
				<li>She eats her food in a particular order.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1>The Sketches</h1>
			<p>To capture the various aspects of our client, we all went and drafted several sketches that played on aspects of her that we had found in our interviews. Some of mine are listed below.</p>

		<h1>The Implementation</h1>
			<p>As this was a group project, we spoke extensively about varying interpretations of the button. Most of these ideas centered around Syndey's love for her dogs and yoga. And so we sought ways to represent that relationship. After reviewing several ideas, we settled on one that symbolized both how her dogs were omnipresent in her life, as well as the sybmolic nature of yoga to calm. To do this, we had a heart symbolize Sydney and had her dogs orbit around her. Upon clicking the button, Sydney would enter a meditative stance from attempting to do yoga. Her dogs would slow down and close in on her, not allowing her to do yoga undisturbed.

			To achieve the desired effect, we needed smooth orbits that slowed down and grew and shrank according to user input, but we discovered this to be mroe difficult than we expected. I worked on smoothing out the shrinking orbits, in addition to centering them.</p>
