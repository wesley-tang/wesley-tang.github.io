				<h1>About Me</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				I am a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Calgary with a concentration in Human Computer Interactions. Creating is my thing, whether it be with the strokes of a keyboard or the lens of a camera, I love to make! Some of my hobbies include coding, gaming, drawing, engaging in spirited discourse regarding the human condition and volunteering at the local animal shelter. My favourite things include dogs, watermelon, my friends and unecessarily and frequently ostentationsly verbose and eloquent prose.

			<h1>Programming</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			My interest in programming probably started in Junior High when I wanted to make a game with a <a href="https://github.com/brian-norman" style="color: rgb(191, 188, 0);">friend</a>. In high school I finally learned how to code and I loved it!

			Languages that I've used/touched before include:

			<h1>Gaming</h1>

			I also play a lot of games, when I have time. Here are the ones I've been playing recently!

		<p>
			I take pictures with a Canon Rebel t3i DSLR Camera which uses a decent telephoto and wide-angle lens that came with the camera, along with a UV and polarizing filter. Since phone cameras have become really amazing, I find that the pictures from my Pixel (original) are pretty nice too and a lot more mobile than having to lug my camera everywhere.
			<br>I make all my art using a Surface Pro 4 with the Surface Pen (the one that first added tilt-sensitivity) and Clip Studio Paint.
